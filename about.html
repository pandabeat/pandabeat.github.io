          <p>About a decade ago, I made the decision to travel down a path that would lead me into the world of technology. After obtaining my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at the University of Calgary, I wanted to shift gears and learn more about the business side of things.  Once I gained some experience as a business analyst at an organization outside the tech industry, I sought out a technical analyst position at a technology company. </p>
          <p>The tech industry was everything I hoped it would be, and I began to immerse myself in the great culture it came with. My role as a technical had me function as a liaison between product developers and technical support teams. During my time in that role, I began to admire the hands-on work that the developers produced. It wasn't long before I wanted to revisit my programming roots. </p>
          <p>Now came the questions of <span class="emphasis">what, where, and how</span>? I noticed that the world was turning towards the web, and how all businesses tried to embrace technology. Venturing into web development seemed like an intelligent choice, so I eagerly began to self-teach myself HTML and CSS through online coding schools. I liked what I was learning, but I wanted to learn in a more efficient way. I researched web development programs in Canada and found Lighthouse Labs here in Vancouver. I decided to quit my job, pack my laptop, and head to the tech-rich west. </p>
          <p>I enjoy using my creativity to engineer solutions, and I am passionate about helping people. I would like to continue to grow as a full stack web developer, and am looking forward to working with a company that is as eager to change the world through code as much as I am. </p>
